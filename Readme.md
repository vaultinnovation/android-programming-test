# Vault Innovation Android Interview Test

Thanks for applying at Vault!

The tests in this exercise shouldn't take more than a hour or so to complete.

## Instructions

Please make the tests in com.vaultinnovation.androidcodetest.ActivityTest all pass.
To get started, fork the repository and make a feature branch for your answers.
Once you're done, create a pull request with your answers.

Modify MainActivity and TextActivity to make the tests pass. Layouts for each activity have
been provided. You may create any additional classes or resource files needed to perform 
this task. When complete, the app should have the following functionality:

1. The title TextView should say "One side makes you larger" in landscape orientation
   and "The other side makes you small" in portrait orientation.
2. Tapping the button should add the text entered into the EditText to the ListView.
3. The ListView items should always be sorted in alphabetical order.
4. Tapping a ListView item should open TextActivity and display the selected item in the
   middle of the screen.

You may modify ActivityTest or the layout xml files if you feel it is helpful, but doing 
this is not necessary to finish the test.
